# Importa
Progressive Web App for supermarket product onboarding

The offline-first, AI-powered operating system for modern retail staff.
Importa is a Progressive Web App designed to replace clunky handheld inventory devices. It allows non-technical staff to capture products, scan barcodes, and manage stock using their personal devices or company tablets, even inside walk-in freezers without Wi-Fi.

⚡ Key Features

📶 Offline-First Architecture: Built on IndexedDB. Capture data anywhere; sync automatically when connection restores.

🤖 AI Autopilot: Upload a photo, and the system auto-generates the product name, description, nutritional info, and SEO tags using GPT-4 Vision.

📷 Integrated Scanning: Built-in Barcode (EAN/UPC) and QR code scanner using the device camera.

🛡️ Role-Based Workflows:

Agents: Capture and submit drafts.

Managers: Tinder-style "Swipe to Approve" interface for quality control.

Admins: Full system configuration and analytics.

📱 Native Feel: Installable to Home Screen (PWA) with haptic feedback and smooth transitions.
